### About biofilmFoam

biofilmFoam is an open-source toolbox dedicated to the micro-continuum simulation of biofilm growth under flow. The model is based on the work of [Eberl et al. (JTM, 2001)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47721792_A_New_Deterministic_Spatio-Temporal_Continuum_Model_for_Biofilm_Development). 

### Dependencies

A functional installation of OpenFOAM is required. Currently, biofilmFoam supports v2206 and following versions (maintenance branches are highly recommended).
