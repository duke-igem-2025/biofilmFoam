### About

`biofilmFoam` is an open-source toolbox based on OpenFOAM to simulate biofilm growth under flows. 
The biofilm model is based on the deterministic approach proposed by [Eberl et al. (JTM, 2001)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47721792_A_New_Deterministic_Spatio-Temporal_Continuum_Model_for_Biofilm_Development). 

### Dependencies

A functional installation of OpenFOAM is required. 
Currently, `biofilmFoam` supports v2206 and following versions (maintenance branches are highly recommended).
