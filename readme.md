### About

`biofilmFoam` is an open-source toolbox based on OpenFOAM to simulate biofilm growth under flows. 
The biofilm model is based on the deterministic approach proposed by
[Eberl et al. (JTM, 2001)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/10273660108833072). 

### Dependencies

A functional installation of OpenFOAM is required. 
Currently, `biofilmFoam` supports v2206 and following versions (maintenance branches are highly recommended).
