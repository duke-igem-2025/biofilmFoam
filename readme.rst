biofilmFoam
===========

About
-----

biofilmFoam is an open-source toolbox based on OpenFOAM to simulate biofilm growth under flows.
The biofilm model is based on the deterministic approach proposed by
`Eberl et al, <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10273660108833072>`_, *CMMM*, **2001**. 

A functional installation of `OpenFOAM <https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/openfoam>`_ is required. 
Currently, biofilmFoam supports `v2206 <https://www.openfoam.com/news/main-news/openfoam-v2206>`_ and following versions (maintenance branches are highly recommended).
